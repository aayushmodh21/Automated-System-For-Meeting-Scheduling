Our model was not suitable for the speech recognition task, So we have decided to use the Web Speech API. The Web Speech API, introduced at the end of 2012, allows web developers to provide speech input and text-to-speech output features in a web browser. The actual recognition is done by a 3rd party server. Because the task of speech recognition currently is just too much for a browser to cope with on it's own or requires a big database.

The process of of our speech meet mailer application goes like this,

First we have the sender who wants to send the meeting link, So that guy will interact with the UI of our application and It takes audio inputs then it uses the web speech API for converting the audio into the text.

Then after that we establish a real time communication between the frontend and the backend server with the help of Socket.IO, What it does that when we have the text, we send it to the backend server then the backend server makes a request with the Dialog Flow API then the Dialog flow api does two things. 

First is to respond back to the backend server and then the backend server acknowledges the Sender with the help of the UI.

Second is Dialog flow makes post requests along with the mail id of the receiver to our other application which is live and hosted at Azure ubuntu servers.

At this machine we have our application which provides the functionality like generating meeting links and sending it to the receiver via SMTP push protocol.


We kept some files hidden because they have some important credentials that were generated by Dialog-Flow API.
